This was my first time creating an Android application and I had little experience in Java. My goal for this project was to create an application that looked aesthetically-pleasing and was unique to the market. I learned how to use Android Studio through online tutorials. As someone who is very into minimalism and decluttering, I wanted to help people out by being able to organize their own homes as a 30 day challenge. Recently, I read <i>The Life Changing Magic of Tidying Up</i> and have incorporated MarieKondoâ€™s suggestions about sparking joy in my life by discarding clutter.
